## Introduction

AVR microcontrollers are very easy to use. All AVR microcontrollers require Integrated Development Environment(IDE) such as Atmel Studio. Using this IDE, we can create, compile and debug program on all AVR microcontrollers.
we will toggle the status of the two LED’s according to the input from a button switch. The circuit needed for this is similar to that of the above section. The only difference is in the programming part. And the working of the circuit is also slightly different. Every time when the controller receives input from the switch,  it will toggle the current status of the two LED’s.
